Merchant Renewable Asset Valuation Framework - Complete Documentation
PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project implements a comprehensive data-driven valuation framework for merchant renewable energy assets that have reached the end of their Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). The framework analyzes historical performance, quantifies risks, and provides hedging decision recommendations for wind and solar assets across different US electricity markets.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY
1. DATA PROCESSING & CLEANING
Input: Historical hourly generation data and real-time/day-ahead prices

Processing: Handles negative prices, missing values, and currency formatting

Output: Cleaned datasets ready for analysis across three assets:

Valentino (Wind - ERCOT market)

Mantero (Wind - MISO market)

Howling Gale (Solar - CAISO market)

2. HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
Key Metrics Calculated:
Capacity Factors: Actual generation vs maximum potential

Price Realization: Average realized prices vs market averages

Revenue Generation: Total and per-MWh revenue calculations

Market Performance: Peak vs off-peak price differentials

Operational Efficiency: Availability factors and generation patterns

Advanced Metrics:
Price volatility and statistical distributions

Negative price event frequency and impact

Seasonal and diurnal generation patterns

Correlation between generation and pricing

3. RISK QUANTIFICATION FRAMEWORK
Value at Risk (VaR) Analysis:
VaR 95%: Worst-case revenue scenarios at 95% confidence level

Conditional VaR (CVaR): Expected loss beyond VaR threshold

Maximum Drawdown: Largest peak-to-trough revenue decline

Revenue Volatility: Standard deviation of revenue streams

Risk Scoring:
Composite risk scores combining price, volume, and market risks

Sharpe and Sortino ratios for risk-adjusted returns

Negative price impact quantification

Extreme event probability analysis

4. FORWARD-LOOKING VALUATION
Revenue Forecasting:
Integration of forward price curves (peak/off-peak)

Risk-adjusted revenue projections over 5-year horizon

Monte Carlo simulations for revenue uncertainty

Seasonal pattern incorporation

Risk Adjustments:
VaR-based risk premiums

Negative price event adjustments

Volatility-based contingencies

Market-specific risk factors

5. HEDGING DECISION FRAMEWORK
Decision Matrix:
Fixed price offers vs merchant exposure comparison

Risk-adjusted price calculations

Confidence-based recommendations

Portfolio-level optimization

Recommendation Categories:
ACCEPT: Fixed price offers exceed risk-adjusted values

CONSIDER: Marginal cases requiring negotiation

REJECT: Merchant exposure preferable to offered prices

NEGOTIATE: Seek improved terms based on risk analysis
